This project regards a customer segmentation provided for a fictional delivery company.

Customers where grouped using 3 different perspectives (Value, Behavior and Preferences).

We tried 2 different clustering approaches and chose Self Organizing Maps as the best method for our approach.

Each Notebook contains a important part of our project:

EDA and Preprocess
KMEANS & HC
SOM & HC
Report including Marketing Strategies and Sugestion for the Company.

Our final decision after merging perspectives was the last notebook (SOM) as it provided a much better Silhoutte Score compared with the Kmeans.

To conclude, a analysis and profile was made for the final clusters.
